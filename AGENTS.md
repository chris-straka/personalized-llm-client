# Ccez Studio — agent handoff

Tauri 2 + Svelte 5 (runes) + TypeScript desktop chatbot (macOS). BYOK chat with
language-learner aids. Frontend owns UI/state; Rust backend is thin and
privileged (Keychain, updater, native TTS).

## Commands

- `bun run dev` — browser-only preview at http://127.0.0.1:5200/ (no Tauri APIs;
  everything must degrade cleanly here).
- `bun run tauri dev` — full shell: Vite on :1420 + Rust backend + app window.
  Use this when touching `src-tauri/` or Tauri invokes. First build compiles
  ~400 crates; be patient.
- `bun run test` — Vitest, colocated `*.test.ts`. Safe anytime.
- `bun run check` / `lint` / `build` — run `svelte-kit sync` and/or invalidate
  HMR. Never run these while a dev server is up and someone is looking at it;
  batch them when the servers are idle.

## Verification economy (slow gates, run once)

- Unit: run only the touched `*.test.ts` while iterating; full `bun run test`
  once at the end.
- `check`: once at the end, not after every edit.
- Playwright: one invocation per file with combined `-g` patterns for every
  new/affected test in it, then the full file once at the end. Never one
  single-test invocation after another — each pays the dev-server wait again.
- Read failure output from that same run (list reporter prints the error);
  don't re-run just to collect details.
- Pristine-tree attribution (`git stash` + rerun) only when a failure
  plausibly relates to the change and blocks; no throwaway debug specs when
  reasoning plus one targeted run can answer it.

## Architecture rules (learned the hard way)

- Chat state is a plain object in `$state` with function updates
  (`src/lib/chat.ts`). Class instances in `$state` never re-render — do not use
  them for UI state.
- Never mutate a message object in place: Svelte proxy signals capture values
  on first read, so streaming updates must replace (`map` + local accumulator).
- Keyboard shortcuts need a capture-phase listener — CodeMirror swallows combos
  (see the `event.code` guards; ⌥R once produced `®`).
- Reads that must subscribe need a synchronous read inside the render effect;
  async-only reads never subscribe (annotation badge marks).
- Every Tauri call must work in three runtimes: Tauri shell, plain browser dev,
  and jsdom tests. Guard with `tauriBackendAvailable()` (see `src/lib/secrets.ts`)
  or try/catch with a local fallback. Never let `invoke` throw into UI teardown.
- Voice has two engines behind one callback contract (`SpeakCallbacks` in
  `src/lib/voice.ts`): web `speechSynthesis` and native `AVSpeechSynthesizer`
  (`src/lib/nativeTts.ts` + `src-tauri/src/tts.rs`, macOS-only, `#[cfg]`-gated
  with stubs elsewhere). Progress returns as `tts-word` / `tts-done` window
  events tagged with a per-utterance id — always check the id, stale cancels
  must not reset newer speech.
- Apple frameworks from Rust go through `objc2` generated bindings only. No
  Objective-C (`.m`), no Swift sidecar: both were evaluated and rejected (same
  engine underneath, worse bundling/signing story). See `src-tauri/src/tts.rs`.
- There is no API that downloads Apple voices. The app picks the best
  *installed* voice per locale and deep-links System Settings to the
  Accessibility pane
  (`x-apple.systempreferences:com.apple.preference.universalaccess`)
  for the rest — sub-anchors are swallowed by System Settings, so UI copy
  must always print the in-pane path. Premium quality requires voices
  downloaded in Accessibility → Read & Speak → System Voice → Manage
  Voices ("Spoken Content" was the pre-26 name).
- Installed-voice inventory is `AVSpeechSynthesisVoice.speechVoices()`, a
  system registry — not a folder scan. There is no user-visible voice
  directory to display.

## Conventions

- Settings: `src/lib/settings.ts` (`defaultSettings`, `saveSettings`); secrets
  go to Keychain via `src/lib/secrets.ts`, never into persisted settings.
- Types are load-bearing compiler feedback, not decoration: `strict` plus
  `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` + `exactOptionalPropertyTypes` (every index and
  optional is guilty until proven defined), type-aware `recommendedTypeChecked`
  lint (`no-floating-promises` enforces the `void`-your-promises convention),
  and branded ids (`ChatId` / `ChatMsgId` / `AnnotationId` in `chat.ts` /
  `annotations.ts`) so a chat id can never be passed as a message id. Zod was
  evaluated and rejected (runtime errors, not compiler feedback; boundaries
  already narrow by hand). TS stays at v6 until `svelte-check` peers allow v7.
- `@types/node` is install-but-never-global (`tsconfig` `types: []`): tooling
  imports it explicitly from `node:*`. Frontend code must never see a global
  `process` — it doesn't exist in the webview.
- Dev-only macOS icon fix lives in `src-tauri/src/dev_icon.rs`
  (`#[cfg(all(target_os = "macos", debug_assertions))]`): `tauri dev` runs
  unbundled, so the switcher tile comes from raw `.icns` bytes reporting
  512pt — the watcher swaps a 128pt tile after Tauri's own lands. Release
  bundles are unaffected (IconServices picks the right rep).
- Tests live next to code (`foo.test.ts`); pure logic must be importable without
  Tauri or DOM (extract `sentenceAtOffset`-style pure helpers to test them).
- Two runners, no more: colocated Vitest (`bun run test`) and Playwright
  (`bun run test:e2e`, specs in `e2e/*.e2e.ts`, seeded via `e2e/helpers.ts`,
  invisible to Vitest by extension). No Testing Library, no other frameworks.
- Vitest environment is node by default; files needing DOM opt in with a
  `// @vitest-environment jsdom` first line. What jsdom can't see (layout,
  layers), assert on source instead (see `actions-reveal.test.ts`, which
  reads `+page.svelte`'s `<style>`).
- Agent-captured verification screenshots go in `.screenshots/` (gitignored),
  never the repo root.
- UI copy: plain prose, no emojis. Enter sends, Shift+Enter newline.
- Spec history: `README.md` (what), `PLAN.md` (full plan), `TODO.md` (checklist;
  check boxes as stages land, don't delete history).

## Environment (user's machine)

- macOS 26.6.2 (build 25G83). System Settings → Accessibility has NO
  "Spoken Content" entry — the Vision section lists "Read & Speak"
  instead, and downloadable voices live under Read & Speak → System
  Voice → Manage Voices. Speech → Live Speech is type-to-speak, NOT
  where voices download. Never write "Spoken Content" in UI copy.

## Known structural debt

- `src/routes/+page.svelte` is ~2.5k lines (sidebar, messages, composer,
  popovers in one file) and stays that way by explicit decision (Sep 2026):
  nothing fixed so far was caused by its size, it is AI-navigable via search,
  and a split buys no user-visible change for real regression risk. Revisit
  only on a concrete trigger — a tangled-state bug, painful HMR, or wanting
  component-level tests. Testing Library is deferred for the same reason:
  test pure logic and bridge contracts with colocated Vitest instead.
