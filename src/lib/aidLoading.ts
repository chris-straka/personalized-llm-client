/**
 * Anti-feedback helpers for the message render effect.
 *
 * The render effect reports furigana load state up to the parent, and the
 * parent re-renders on every load-state change. If the effect reported
 * unconditionally (or re-started conversion on every re-run), completion's
 * `false` would trigger a re-render that re-runs the effect and restarts
 * the conversion: an infinite busy-toggle loop that pegs the CPU and
 * starves Svelte's flush so no click ever lands. These pure helpers pin
 * down the two contracts that break the loop; the component wires them in.
